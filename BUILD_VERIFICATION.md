# Build Verification Checklist

## âœ… Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Vercel Build Errors Fixed**
- [x] Fixed `react/no-unescaped-entities` in pricing page (line 566) - Changed "What's" to "What&apos;s"
- [x] Fixed unused `locale` variable in layout.tsx - Now properly passed to getMessages()
- [x] Updated i18n structure from `i18n.ts` to `i18n/request.ts` for next-intl 3.22+

- [x] Added webpack config to handle Supabase realtime warnings

### 2. **SSR & Hydration Issues Fixed**
- [x] Added `typeof window` checks before localStorage access in:
  - app/profile/page.tsx
  - app/[locale]/pricing/page.tsx  
  - app/studio/page.tsx
  - app/studio-management/page.tsx
- [x] Added error handling for JSON.parse operations
- [x] Improved localStorage cleanup on parsing errors

### 3. **Performance Improvements**
- [x] Enhanced fetch calls with proper caching headers (5-minute cache)
- [x] Improved error handling with proper HTTP status checks
- [x] Added meaningful error messages for failed API calls

### 4. **Security & Code Quality**
- [x] Verified input validation exists in all API endpoints

- [x] Validated flexible layouts (flex-col sm:flex-row)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Run npm audit fix --force** (if needed)
2. **Run npm run build** to verify no build errors
3. **Run npm run lint** to check for any linting issues
4. **Deploy to Vercel**
